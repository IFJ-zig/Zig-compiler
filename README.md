# IFJ/IAL School Group Project (ChatGPT generated)

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **IFJ** (Formal Languages and Compilers) and **IAL** (Algorithms) courses and involves implementing a compiler using the Zig programming language (version 0.13). Our implementation will translate code into **IFJcode24**, a three-address, stack-based target code.

We are a team of 4 students, tasked with creating this compiler over the course of the semester. The project includes both code implementation and comprehensive documentation, with each component contributing to the final grade.

## Team Members

- **Student 1**: Responsible for [specific module/task].
- **Student 2**: Responsible for [specific module/task].
- **Student 3**: Responsible for [specific module/task].
- **Student 4**: Responsible for [specific module/task].

## Project Structure

The project is built using **C**. **Zig** an imperative, statically typed language with type inference and immutable variables. It features local variables, data types such as `i32`, `f64`, and `[]u8` (but not for literals), and prefix `?` for null types.

The compiler will handle:

- User-defined and built-in functions.
- Operations with `stdin/stdout`.
- String handling and conversions.

The final output is **IFJcode24**, a three-address stack-based code. The compilation will be done using **Visual Studio Code** with the [IFJcode24 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=okrejci.ippc-ifjc).

## Grading Breakdown

- **18 points** for compiler implementation in C.
  - 5 points will be awarded for the **IAL** course based on this component.
- **5 points** for documentation and project management.
  - Another 5 points for **IAL** will be based on these.
- **5 points** for additional activities (e.g., extensions, forum activity, bug reports, or competitions).
- **5 points** for the final project defense.
  - An additional 5 points for **IAL** will be based on the defense.
